# Webadapter Demo #

We provide a demonstration server for the EPCIS Webadapter. This lets you browse and interact with the content of the Fosstrak EPCIS (or any compliant EPCIS) with any web browser, web language, or HTTP library.

An instance of the EPCIS Webadapter interface can be found here:

The EPC Mashup Dashboard is a Javascript client (running on Google App Engine) that demonstrates how the EPCIS Webadapter helps building lightweight (e.g., mobile, mashup) applications on top of the EPCIS Respository featuring the Webadapter. You can access it here (best viewed with Firefox):

http://epcmashup.webofthings.com

Note, this later application is here for demonstration purposes only and should not be considered as "ready for production".
