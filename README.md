Fosstrak is an open source RFID software platform that implements the GS1 EPC Network specifications.

How can Fosstrak help you?
- If you are an RFID system integrator, deploy Fosstrak software components such as the EPCglobal-certified Fosstrak EPCIS as part of your solution.
- If you are an RFID application developer, use the Java libraries of Fosstrak for the non-custom parts of your application, e.g. Fosstrak TDT for the translation between different tag identifier formats or Fosstrak Filtering and Collection Middleware for tag data processing.
- If you are a researcher or student, use our software as a starting point for your work, e.g. to develop new discovery systems that require multiple EPCIS installations.
