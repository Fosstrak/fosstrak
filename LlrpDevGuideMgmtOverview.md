# Developer Guide: Management #

The "Management" chapter provides an overview to the implementation of all the background reader and adaptor management facilities.

It is structured into 3 subchapters:
  * Adaptor Management
  * Adaptors
  * Readers

The Adaptor Management has been developed in a modular way allowing it to be used without the GUI client (Commander). One of the standalone usages is within the LLRP driver for the fosstrak application layer events middleware (filtering and collection).
