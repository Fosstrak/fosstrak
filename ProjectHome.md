Fosstrak is an open source RFID software platform that implements the GS1 EPC Network specifications.

# How can Fosstrak help you? #

  * If you are an RFID **system integrator**, deploy Fosstrak software components such as the **EPCglobal-certified Fosstrak EPCIS** as part of your solution.

  * If you are an RFID **application developer**, use the Java libraries of Fosstrak for the non-custom parts of your application, e.g. **Fosstrak TDT** for the translation between different tag identifier formats or **Fosstrak Filtering and Collection Middleware** for tag data processing.

  * If you are a **researcher or student**, use our software as a starting point for your work, e.g. to develop new discovery systems that require multiple EPCIS installations.
