# Capturing Application #

In the EPC Network, a "capturing application" writes events to an EPCIS repository. In many situations, developers will want to write their own, custom capturing application.

Fosstrak ALE contains a blueprint for such a capturing application. It generates events for an EPCIS repository based on `ECReports` from the ALE Filtering and Collection middleware.

To try out the capturing application in a simple scenario, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](AleCapturingAppQuickStart.md). For more details, please refer to the [Developer Guide](AleCapturingAppDevGuide.md).
