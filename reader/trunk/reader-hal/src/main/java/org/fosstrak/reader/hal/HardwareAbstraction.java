/**
 * The standardized interface defines an abstraction of the underlaying reader hardware. The HardwareAbstraction interface defines 
 * a set of methods that can be implemented by any so called HAL controller class. A class that implements 
 * the interface agrees to implement all the methods defined in the interface, thereby agreeing to certain behavior.
 * 
 * The functionality provided by the interface is kept as generally as possible in order not to exclude certain
 * readers. The hardware itself has to comply with the following minimal requirements in order to be supported by the framework.
 * 
 * The minimal assumption about the proprietary RFID systems is that the reader allows the identification of tags by a unique serial number.
 * The tag's unique serial number, i.e. identifier, has to be specified as a String representing a hexadecimal number. The hexadecimal digits
 * are the ordinary, base-10 digits '0' through '9' plus the letters 'A' through 'F'. In the hexadecimal system, these digits represent 
 * the values 0 through 15, respectively. A hexadecimal integer is a sequence of hexadecimal digits, such as 34A7, FF8, 174204. Depending
 * on the concrete hardware this String will be converted into a convenient format, for example a byte array.
 *
 * In the HAL model, the memory is devided into memory banks that can be addressed. In each memory bank the memory can be accessed
 * in block units, whereas the blocksize has to be specified in a corresponding properties file. Despite the block size, memory is
 * specified in bytes. Since Java does not support unsigned bytes as basic types the class <code>UnsignedByteArray</code> is used to represent
 * array of bytes. In general, a HAL controller instance can offer it's own memory bank model, i.e. the number of memory banks and
 * the content of certain memory banks such as EPCs, Tag IDs, or Passwords. To avoid confusion the following memory model is suggested
 * which is given in the EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 specification:
 * 		memory bank 0: protected
 * 		memory bank 1: EPC (Electronic Product Code or other object IDs, read only)
 * 		memory bank 2: Tag ID (factory programmed ID, read only)
 * 		memory bank 3: user memory (read/write)
 * In addition, more memory banks could be used for user memory or to retrieve values of sensors mounted on a tag. Even if the underlaying
 * reader hardware does not support EPCs, the memory bank model could be implemented using the provided memory of the reader hardware.
 * 
 * The HAL controller implementation has to decide which of the IDs should be the master ID of the tag that is returned when
 * performing an <code>identify</code> command. In an <code>Observation</code> the type of ID has to be specified.
 * 
 * HAL controller implementations have to take the memory block size of  the underlaying reader hardware into account. When performing a 
 * read operation only the requested number of bytes should be returned to the client even if more bytes have to be read to satisfy the 
 * block size constraints. When writing data to tag memory a preceding read operation might be necessary to avoid overwriting of memory
 * with empty data used to fit the block size.
